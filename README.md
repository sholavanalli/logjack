# Logjack - move logs without heavy lifting.

Logjack reads log files and moves log lines to configured sender. A directory scanner constantly keeps track of the active log files and starts a log file reader when it finds a new log file in the directory. Log file reader sends log lines to the configured sender. 

Application configuration is in config.yml. 

To build the project: ./gradlew build
To run: java -jar build/libs/logjack-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
